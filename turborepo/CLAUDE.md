## Standard Workflow
1. First, please think through the problem, consider any superior alternatives I may have overlooked, and read the codebase for relevant files; then write a plan in the [todo.md](./todo.md) file. use `---` notation to separate any pre-existing todo entries when creating a new todo list.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before executing the plan, please verify the intended plan with me.
4. Please check off to-do items as they're completed.
5. If you have a question, please ask! I'll be more than happy to help if I can.
6. Please provide a high-level summary of changes made after completing each step
7. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication; please avoid making unnecessarily complex changes if an equally viable and simpler path exists.
8. Finally, please add a review section to the [todo.md](./todo.md) file summarizing each change made and any other relevant information when wrapping up.
