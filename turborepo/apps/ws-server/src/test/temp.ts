  "The town in the US with the highest elevation that is permanently inhabited year-round is **Alma, Colorado**.\n\n### About Alma, Colorado\n\n*   **Elevation:** Alma is officially recognized as the highest incorporated municipality in North America, with its town hall located at **10,361 feet (3,158 meters)** above sea level. Some parts of the town extend even higher.\n*   **Location:** It's nestled in Park County, in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, south of Hoosier Pass and north of Fairplay, along Highway 9.\n*   **Population:** Alma is a very small town, with a population typically hovering around 200-300 residents.\n*   **History:** Like many towns in the Colorado Rockies, Alma was founded as a mining town during the gold and silver rushes of the late 19th century. Its history is tied to the boom-and-bust cycles of the mining industry.\n*   **Life in Alma:**\n    *   **Isolation:** While not extremely remote, it's a small community with limited services. Residents often travel to nearby Breckenridge (about 30 minutes north) or Fairplay for more extensive shopping and amenities.\n    *   **Outdoor Recreation:** Its location makes it a prime spot for outdoor enthusiasts. It's a popular base for hiking, fishing, camping, and climbing \"14ers\" (mountains over 14,000 feet), including Quandary Peak which towers over the town. Skiing is also popular in the nearby resorts.\n    *   **Challenges:** Living at such high elevation presents significant challenges, including the extreme weather, the thin air (which affects health, cooking, and even vehicle performance), and the general ruggedness of mountain life.\n    *   **Community:** Despite the challenges, Alma boasts a close-knit community and a unique mountain town vibe. It even has its own local brewery!\n\n### Alma's Climate\n\nAlma experiences a severe **alpine climate**, characterized by long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. The high elevation is the primary driver of its extreme weather patterns.\n\n*   **Winters (Late October to May):**\n    *   **Temperatures:** Brutally cold. Daytime highs are often well below freezing (32°F or 0°C), and nighttime lows frequently drop into the single digits Fahrenheit (-15°C to -20°C) or even below zero. Extreme cold snaps can push temperatures to -20°F (-29°C) or lower, exacerbated by wind chill.\n    *   **Snowfall:** Very heavy. Alma receives a significant amount of snow, often accumulating several feet over the winter months. Snowfall can occur from early autumn through late spring, and even into early summer at higher elevations.\n    *   **Duration:** Winters are long, typically lasting from late October or early November well into May.\n    *   **Sunshine:** Despite the cold and snow, Alma often experiences abundant sunshine, even in winter, due to its high altitude. However, the UV index is very high.\n\n*   **Summers (June to September):**\n    *   **Temperatures:** Short and cool. Daytime highs typically range from the low 60s to low 70s Fahrenheit (15-23°C). Nights are always chilly, often dropping into the 30s Fahrenheit (0-5°C), meaning frost is possible even in mid-summer.\n    *   **Precipitation:** Summer brings more rain, often in the form of afternoon thunderstorms, but total precipitation is not extremely high due to the general aridity of the region.\n    *   **Snow Risk:** It's not uncommon for Alma to see an early or late-season dusting of snow in June or September, especially at higher elevations around the town.\n\n*   **Other Climate Factors:**\n    *   **Thin Air:** The air is significantly thinner than at sea level, meaning less oxygen. This affects everything from human physiology (altitude sickness is common for visitors) to how engines run and how water boils (at a lower temperature).\n    *   **Winds:** The town can be very windy, especially during winter storms, which makes the already bitter cold feel even more severe due to wind chill.\n    *   **Rapid Temperature Swings:** High altitude areas can experience rapid temperature drops, especially after sunset or when clouds move in.\n\nIn summary, Alma's climate is challenging, requiring resilience and adaptation from its year-round residents, who embrace the rugged beauty and unique lifestyle of living at the top of the world in the Lower 48.";
